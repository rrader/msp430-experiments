SW-420 Motion Sensor Module Vibration Switch Alarm Sensor Module
===========================

Clockwise - less sensitivity
Counterclockwise - more sensitivity


Purpose:
Used to trigger the effect of various vibration, theft alarm, intelligent car, earthquake alarm, motorcycle alarm, etc.
This module is compared with the normally open type vibration sensor module, vibration trigger for longer periods of time, can drive the relay module

Module features:
1, the company produced normally closed type vibration sensor SW-420,.
2, the comparator output, signal clean, good waveform, driving ability is strong, for more than 15 ma
3, the working voltage of 3.3V to 5V
4, output form: digital switch output (0 and 1)
5, has a fixed bolt hole, convenient installation
6, small board PCB size: 3.2cm x 1.4cm
7, use the LM393 wide voltage comparator

Module directions for use:
1, product no vibration, vibration switch is closed on state, the output terminal output low level, the green light is lit;
2, product vibration, the vibration switch instantaneous disconnection, output the output high level, the green light is not bright;
3, output can be directly connected to microcontroller, through single chip microcomputer to detect the high and low level, thus to detect whether there is a vibration environment, call the police
