/*
 MSP430 Notes:
 This timer currently uses Timer1 available on chips like the MSP430G2553
 It uses CCR0 in interrupt mode with the same period as PWM so PWM is 
 still available for Timer1 which means pwm , analogWrite() is still available
 on the Timer1 associated pins.  We couild have hacked into the watchdog timer
 which is used for millis() but that would have been a core change.
 
 The MSP430/Energia Servo library uses Timer0 so this library should be able to 
 run concurrently with Servo.  
 
 It will not run at the same time as the interrupt driven software serial library
 because that uses both timer interrupt vectors
 
 Stellaris/Tiva Notes:
 This uses SysTick.  It registers an instance of this with registerSysTickCb delegating
 the work to the passed in handler.


 Note the differnce in behavior. 
   MSP430 starts and stops the timer.  More CPU constrained so better to give back clock cycles 
   Tiva / Stellaris just ignores the calls because can't unregister
